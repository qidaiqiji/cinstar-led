                <p>Indoor rental events are seeing a growing preference for lower pixel pitch. It decreased from 3.9mm years ago to its current pitch of 2.6mm or even lower at 1.5mm. One of the primary reasons is that clients have high expectations for delivering visually stunning and higher quality images to their audience. Having a rental video screen with a lower pixel pitch than others can give you a significant competitive advantage in the market. The market and competition are inherently intertwined. </p>
                <p>Outdoor LED display screen is often employed in outdoor rental events such as sport venues, touring, concerts, and music festivals. In these settings, it is crucial for the LED screen to be both waterproof (IP65 or IP54) and highly bright (exceeding 5000nits). When it comes to outdoor events, the focus is not so much on the pixel pitch, but rather on the durability and stability. The current market demand is for pixel pitches of 3.9mm and 2.9mm, but it is expected to decrease in the near future. </p>

                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter4">Installations of Rental LED Video Wall</h3>
                <p>Rental LED video screens are designed to cater to a wide range of installations, depending on the specific event requirements. They have become a popular choice for mainstream video equipment. These are the most widely employed installations for LED display screens.</p>
                <p><b>Truss Suspension</b></p>
                <p>When it comes to events that call for LED wall rental display to be hanging, a suspension installation is the way to go. It would be ideal if there are already suspension points available on the site. Simply connect suspension points and rental LED panels using suspension brackets. On the contrary, a truss might be required to provide support for the entire LED screen. </p>
                <p>When it comes to installing the LED screen for stage rental with suspension, it's important to carefully calculate the weight capacity of the rigging and suspension bracket.

                <p><b>Wall Mounted</b></p>
                <p>When the LED display screen needs to be installed against the wall, the most common method is wall mounted installation. To complete the installation, you will require a sturdy wall-mounted structure frame. Attach the rental LED video wall panel to the frame using connecting plates. It is important to consider the weight capacity of the wall when installing the LED display and structure frame, and this calculation should be done at the early stage of the project. </p>
                <p><b>Floor Stacking</b></p>
                <p>When it comes to events that cannot be rigged or wall mounted, the focus is on ground/floor stacking. Typically, the factory will provide a stacking system that is compatible with the LED screen for this type of installation. When setting up the stacking system, it's important to ensure that the stacking frame is positioned on a level surface. Otherwise, if there are any gaps on the LED display wall, it could potentially impact the quality of the image. What is more, It is vital to ensure that the giant LED screen for stage rental with ground stacking system is built with sufficient weight load to prevent any risk of falling forward. </p>

                <p>When it comes to LED advertising display projects, the requirements have been set prior to the start of the project. However, the rental market can be quite complex, especially if you are new to it or considering investing in a rental LED display for a specific event. </p>
                <p>Prior to taking any actions, it is crucial to address two key tasks: Collect comprehensive market information while assess the expected size of your business.</p>
                <p><b>In-depth Market Research</b></p>
                <p>If you're new to the LED wall rental market and looking to invest in a LED display screen rental to kickstart your business, Here are some questions that can provide you with a broad understanding of the market:</p>
                <p>Do you know the key players in the market, their main business, and what type of LED display they use?</p>
                <p>Which market segments are you targeting, who are your competitors, and what sets you apart from them?</p>
                <p>What is the rental price that clients are willing to pay for the service? How long can you cover the cost and make a profit?</p>
                <p>If you have a solid understanding of these questions and are still eager to enter the market, you will be able to determine the ideal LED video wall rental screen for your needs. </p>
                <p><b>Business Scale Prediction</b></p>
                <p>Whether you're investing in a rental LED display screen for a specific event or for your growing business, it's important to foresee the scale of your business. For example, if you are required to provide a 50sqm LED screen for an event and you plan to continue using it afterwards. So, how many square meters are you planning to buy?  </p>
                <p>Prior to addressing this question, it is important to note a significant issue with LED display screen - the problem of batches. If you purchase a LED display now and later decide to buy more to complement your existing display for larger events, you will realize that they cannot be used together as one screen. Because these LEDs come from two different batches, each with its own unique color and brightness. This scenario is a common occurrence.</p>
                <p>Returning to that question, you will now have a more practical answer by reflecting on your past events and making predictions about the scale of your business in the near future.</p>
