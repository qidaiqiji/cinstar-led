                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter6">Chapter 6  What to Consider Before Buying Rental LED Screens?</h3>
                <p>When it comes to LED advertising display projects, the requirements have been set prior to the start of the project. However, the rental market can be quite complex, especially if you are new to it or considering investing in a rental LED display for a specific event. </p>
                <p>Prior to taking any actions, it is crucial to address two key tasks: Collect comprehensive market information while assess the expected size of your business.</p>
                <p><b>In-depth Market Research</b></p>
                <p>If you're new to the LED wall rental market and looking to invest in a rental LED display screen to kickstart your business, Here are some questions that can provide you with a broad understanding of the market:</p>
                <p>Do you know the key players in the market, their main business, and what type of rental LED display they use?</p>
                <p>Which market segments are you targeting, who are your competitors, and what sets you apart from them?</p>
                <p>What is the rental price that clients are willing to pay for the service? How long can you cover the cost and make a profit?</p>
