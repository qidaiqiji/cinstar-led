                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter2">Chapter 2 Applications of Rental LED Display Screen</h3>
                <p>Rental LED display screen is categorized upon its application environment, with two primary categories: indoor and outdoor rental LED screen. Typically, the indoor and outdoor models of the same series LED display screen have a shared frame design and can be built together in one screen. </p>
                <p>Indoor rental LED video wall is typically used for indoor rental events such as exhibitions, award ceremonies, fashion shows, car shows, weddings, and conference rooms. For these applications, the indoor LED displays do not require waterproofing and do not need to be excessively bright. However, it is essential for the LED display to meet the necessary standards in order to provide exceptional image quality and outstanding visual performance. </p>
                <div class="img-box">
                    <img src="https://www.cinstar-led.com/images/products/new-page/rental-led-display-screen/rental-led-display-screen-5.jpg" alt="LED display screen rental-5">
                </div>
                <p>Indoor rental events are seeing a growing preference for lower pixel pitch. It decreased from 3.9mm years ago to its current pitch of 2.6mm or even lower at 1.5mm. One of the primary reasons is that clients have high expectations for delivering visually stunning and higher quality images to their audience. Having a rental video screen with a lower pixel pitch than others can give you a significant competitive advantage in the market. The market and competition are inherently intertwined. </p>
                <p>Outdoor LED display screen is often employed in outdoor rental events such as sport venues, touring, concerts, and music festivals. In these settings, it is crucial for the LED screen to be both waterproof (IP65 or IP54) and highly bright (exceeding 5000nits). When it comes to outdoor events, the focus is not so much on the pixel pitch, but rather on the durability and stability. The current market demand is for pixel pitches of 3.9mm and 2.9mm, but it is expected to decrease in the near future. </p>

                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter4">Chapter 3  Installations of Rental LED Video Wall</h3>
                <p>Rental LED video screens are designed to cater to a wide range of installations, depending on the specific event requirements. They have become a popular choice for mainstream video equipment. These are the most widely employed installations for LED display screens.</p>
                <p><b>Truss Suspension</b></p>
                <p>When it comes to events that call for LED wall rental display to be hanging, a suspension installation is the way to go. It would be ideal if there are already suspension points available on the site. Simply connect suspension points and rental LED panels using suspension brackets. On the contrary, a truss might be required to provide support for the entire LED screen. </p>
                <p>When it comes to installing the LED screen for stage rental with suspension, it's important to carefully calculate the weight capacity of the rigging and suspension bracket. Before beginning the setup, it's crucial to have accurate information on the weight capacity of the LED screen panel and bracket, which should be provided by the manufacturer. It is crucial to prioritize safety, as even a small mistake can have catastrophic consequences. </p>

                </div>
                <p><b>Wall Mounted</b></p>
                <p>When the LED display screen needs to be installed against the wall, the most common method is wall mounted installation. To complete the installation, you will require a sturdy wall-mounted structure frame. Attach the rental LED video wall panel to the frame using connecting plates. It is important to consider the weight capacity of the wall when installing the LED display and structure frame, and this calculation should be done at the early stage of the project. </p>
                <p><b>Floor Stacking</b></p>
                <p>When it comes to events that cannot be rigged or wall mounted, the focus is on ground/floor stacking. Typically, the factory will provide a stacking system that is compatible with the LED screen for this type of installation. When setting up the stacking system, it's important to ensure that the stacking frame is positioned on a level surface. Otherwise, if there are any gaps on the LED display wall, it could potentially impact the quality of the image. What is more, It is vital to ensure that the giant LED screen for stage rental with ground stacking system is built with sufficient weight load to prevent any risk of falling forward. </p>

                <p>Actually, LED screens are still considered a type of monitor. It has the ability to display a wide range of contents. However, its signal reception is limited to specific types. It is important to consider the signals that will be connected to the LED display when purchasing extra devices. Discover a range of peripheral devices available for your rental screens.</p>
                <p><b>Multi-media Video Processor</b></p>
                <p>The video processor is an essential piece of equipment for LED display rental events. Initially, the input signals need to be converted to a format that can be accepted by the rental LED video wall. For instance, a live broadcast captured by a camera needs the processor with SDI input. In addition, the video processor can simplify your content management and enhance the visual impact of the LED display screen rental. </p>
                <p><b>Advanced Splicing Processor</b></p>
                <p>When applying an ultra-high resolution screen rental for events to provide a captivating visual experience for viewers, it may be necessary to use a splicing processor to set up the LED wall rental screen. </p>
                <p>For example, a large rental LED screen with over 10 million pixels requires a splicing video processor to configure it into a complete LED video display, as the normal NovaStar controllers can only load part of the display. </p>
                <p><b>Flight Case</b></p>
                <p>When it comes to rental events, having a road case or flight case is crucial for efficient packing and speedy transportation. Typically, rental LED display screen is packaged with flight cases by factories. However, feel free to use your own flight case if you prefer. </p>
                <p><b>Power Distribution Device </b></p>
                <p>Power cable layout can be quite challenging when dealing with a large LED display screen rental. Imagine a rental event where a large LED display is needed, but the power interfaces are located 20-50 meters away from the display. Without power distribution device, managing power cable layout can become quite challenging. However, power distribution device operates differently, even in situations where there are only a few power interfaces available on site. </p>

                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter6">Chapter 5  What to Consider Before Buying Rental LED Screen?</h3>
                <p>When it comes to LED advertising display projects, the requirements have been set prior to the start of the project. However, the rental market can be quite complex, especially if you are new to it or considering investing in a rental LED display for a specific event. </p>
                <p>Prior to taking any actions, it is crucial to address two key tasks: Collect comprehensive market information while assess the expected size of your business.</p>
                <p><b>In-depth Market Research</b></p>
                <p>If you're new to the LED wall rental market and looking to invest in a LED display screen rental to kickstart your business, Here are some questions that can provide you with a broad understanding of the market:</p>
                <p>Do you know the key players in the market, their main business, and what type of LED display they use?</p>
                <p>Which market segments are you targeting, who are your competitors, and what sets you apart from them?</p>
                <p>What is the rental price that clients are willing to pay for the service? How long can you cover the cost and make a profit?</p>
                <p>If you have a solid understanding of these questions and are still eager to enter the market, you will be able to determine the ideal LED video wall rental screen for your needs. </p>
                <p><b>Business Scale Prediction</b></p>
                <p>Whether you're investing in a rental LED display screen for a specific event or for your growing business, it's important to foresee the scale of your business. For example, if you are required to provide a 50sqm LED screen for an event and you plan to continue using it afterwards. So, how many square meters are you planning to buy?  </p>
                <p>Prior to addressing this question, it is important to note a significant issue with LED display screen - the problem of batches. If you purchase a LED display now and later decide to buy more to complement your existing display for larger events, you will realize that they cannot be used together as one screen. Because these LEDs come from two different batches, each with its own unique color and brightness. This scenario is a common occurrence.</p>
                <p>Returning to that question, you will now have a more practical answer by reflecting on your past events and making predictions about the scale of your business in the near future.</p>
