                <h2 class="title">What is a Transparent LED Film Screen?</h2>
                <p>The transparent LED film screen is a flexible, thin display that adheres directly to clear surfaces or glass, allowing for seamless integration. It contains LEDs embedded in a sheet of clear material. It will enable you to project high-quality videos or images on glass walls or windows without obstructing views or sunlight.</p>
                <p>When turned off, it’s nearly invisible. When active, it displays vivid content with rich color tones in a modern, open setting.</p>
                <p>The screens offer up to 90% transparency or more. It provides the lowest weight, ease of installation, and advanced design flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of uses and environments.</p>
