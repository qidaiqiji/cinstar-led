                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter4">How to Control LED Advertising Board?</h3>
                <p>LED advertising board can be controlled in two ways: synchronous control and asynchronous control, based on the manners of signal transmission. Here is the differences between them. </p>
                <p><b>Synchronous Controlling</b></p>
                <p>Synchronous control refers to the capability of an LED advertising display board to show text, images, or videos from a controlling computer or other input devices such as TV signals, cameras, or VCRs. For real-time signal transmission, it is necessary to maintain a constant connection between the screen and the controlling computer or video processor. In the event of a connection failure, the commercial advertising screen will be unable to receive the signal and will not display any content. </p>
                <p>
                Synchronous control is extensively employed in commercial advertising screens, rental LED displays, sports LED displays, and other large-format LED displays.</p>
                <div class="img-box">
                    <img src="https://www.cinstar-led.com/images/products/new-page/led-advertising-display/led-advertising-display-8.jpg" alt="LED Sdvertising Display-8">
                </div>
                <p><b>Asynchronous controlling</b></p>
                <p>Asynchronous controlling LED screen has the capability to operate autonomously and does not require a constant connection to a controlling computer that is necessary only for the purpose of editing the advertisement content. The advertisement content will be transmitted to the control card inside the screen implementing various means of data transmission, such as a UTP cat5 cable, USB drive, WiFi connection, 4G wireless, or other methods. Upon successful transmission of the data to the control card, it will be stored on its memory card. Subsequently, you have the option to sever the connection. The control card will continue to show the videos and graphics until you manually deactivate it. </p>
                <p>Asynchronous control is most suitable for installations when the controlling computer is located far away from commercial LED screen or where it is difficult to do the necessary wiring at the installation place. This control approach is typically employed for small size LED display screens, LED displays on roadsides, or outdoor advertising LED displays.</p>

                <p><b>Installation License and Permit</b></p>
                <p>Whether you're an importer or an end user, the progress of your installation permit application can have a significant impact on your entire purchasing process, particularly for <a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.cinstar-led.com/products/outdoor-led-display-screen.php">outdoor LED display screen</a> installations. Once you have obtained the required permit, you will be able to purchase the LED screen for advertising outdoors. Otherwise, if you've made a purchase, it can only be stored in your warehouse. If you choose to install it without the necessary permit, there is a possibility that the government may take action to have it removed.</p>
                <p>For example, if you're considering installing an LED advertising screen outdoors on a building's facade facing the road. It is important to obtain permission from the building owner before proceeding, followed by obtaining the necessary permit from your community. Finally, the permit from the Roads Administration or a similar department may be obtained. Policies regarding permits vary across different regions and countries.</p>
                <p>It is important for you to determine the status of the permit and crucial to ensure that the purchase is made only when the permit is ready or nearly complete. Otherwise, all your efforts may go to waste.</p>
