                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter4">Chapter 4  How to Control LED Advertising Screen?</h3>
                <p>LED advertising screens can be controlled in two ways: synchronous control and asynchronous control, based on the manners of signal transmission. Here is the differences between them. </p>
                <p><b>Synchronous Controlling</b></p>
                <p>Synchronous control refers to the capability of an LED advertising display board to show text, images, or videos from a controlling computer or other input devices such as TV signals, cameras, or VCRs. For real-time signal transmission, it is necessary to maintain a constant connection between the LED advertising screen and the controlling computer or video processor. In the event of a connection failure, the commercial LED advertising screen will be unable to receive the signal and will not display any content. </p>
                <p>
                Synchronous control is extensively employed in commercial LED advertising screens, rental LED displays, sports LED displays, and other large-format LED displays.</p>

                </div>
                <p><b>Asynchronous controlling</b></p>
                <p>Asynchronous controlling LED advertising screen has the capability to operate autonomously and does not require a constant connection to a controlling computer that is necessary only for the purpose of editing the advertisement content. The advertisement content will be transmitted to the control card inside the LED advertising screen implementing various means of data transmission, such as a UTP cat5 cable, USB drive, WiFi connection, 4G wireless, or other methods. Upon successful transmission of the data to the control card, it will be stored on its memory card. Subsequently, you have the option to sever the connection. The control card will continue to show the videos and graphics until you manually deactivate it. </p>
                <p>Asynchronous control is most suitable for installations when the controlling computer is located far away from commercial LED screen or where it is difficult to do the necessary wiring at the installation place. This control approach is typically employed for small size LED display screens, LED displays on roadsides, or outdoor advertising LED displays.</p>

                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter5">Chapter 5  What to Consider When Buying Commercial Advertising LED Screen</h3>
                <p>If you operate as an importer in your local market, you have the option to simply procure the LED advertising screen as per your client's specific need. However, if you are a newcomer seeking to acquire an LED screen for the purpose of operating your own advertising business.  Here are some suggestions for you to take into consideration.</p>
                <p><b>Sophisticated Market Research</b></p>

By understanding the different types of LED advertising displays, you can determine which one is most suitable for your business.  </p>
                <p>In addition, it is important to determine the price that advertisers are willing to pay for the campaign.

                <p><b>Installation License and Permit</b></p>
                <p>Whether you're an importer or an end user, the progress of your installation permit application can have a significant impact on your entire purchasing process, particularly for outdoor LED display screen installations. Once you have obtained the required permit, you will be able to purchase the LED advertising display. Otherwise, if you've made a purchase, it can only be stored in your warehouse. If you choose to install it without the necessary permit, there is a possibility that the government may take action to have it removed. </p>
                <p>For example, if you're considering installing an LED advertising screen on a building's facade facing the road. It is important to obtain permission from the building owner before proceeding, followed by obtaining the necessary permit from your community. Finally, the permit from the Roads Administration or a similar department may be obtained. Policies regarding permits vary across different regions and countries.</p>
                <p>It is important for you to determine the status of the permit and crucial to ensure that the purchasing is done only when the permit is ready or nearly completion. Otherwise, all your efforts may go to waste. </p>
