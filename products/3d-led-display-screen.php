Unlike traditional LED displays that show flat images, a 3D display screen leverages the arrangement of pixels and light to produce depth and movement. This technology typically involves using a specialized layer of optical lenses or parallax barriers that direct light to each eye, creating the illusion of depth."

                <p>The primary difference between 2D and 3D displays rests in our perception of the object represented on the screen.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.15rem;line-height: 1.5;">Dimensions: 2D LED displays often are flat and require solely two dimensions: length and width. On the contrary, the 3D LED wall panel includes a dimension of depth in addition to the dimensions of length and width.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.15rem;line-height: 1.5;">The addition of a third dimension in 3D LED wall panels enhances the realism of sights or images as compared to 2D displays. The application of 3D effects on huge LED screens improves the viewers' perception of the presented visuals. It enables the audience to see the illusion of three dimensions, witness the interactions of shadows and lights, and detect their movements.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.15rem;line-height: 1.5;">The 3D billboard display is currently popular in the market due to its capacity to efficiently present complicated and high-dimensional images and objects, which is advantageous for users.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.15rem;line-height: 1.5;">The appearance of 3D LED billboards enables advertisers and enterprises to highlight their brands and facilitate a more immersive technique that enhances the visual senses engagement.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.15rem;line-height: 1.5;">3D billboards have the advantage of transcending beyond the constraints of typical two-dimensional or flat LED display billboards. With this renewed ability, you can now generate LED screen displays that are more engaging and attractive, setting you apart from others.</li>

                <h3 class="chapter-title">2.How Does a 3D Display Screen Work?</h3>
                <p>A 3D display screen uses advanced technology to create the illusion of three-dimensional images without the need for special glasses. Unlike traditional LED displays that show flat images, a 3D display screen leverages the arrangement of pixels and light to produce depth and movement. This technology typically involves using a specialized layer of optical lenses or parallax barriers that direct light to each eye, creating the illusion of depth.</p>
                <p>In a 3D display screen, the LED modules display images in a sequence that varies slightly for each eye. This process mimics how human eyes perceive depth and distance, delivering a more immersive experience.</p>              
                <h3 class="chapter-title">3.Is 3D LED Display Suitable for Outdoor Use?</h3>
                <p>Yes, <strong>3D LED display</strong> is highly suitable for outdoor use, offering a unique and engaging way to captivate audiences in public spaces. They are designed to withstand various environmental factors, such as rain, dust, and extreme temperatures, making them durable enough for outdoor installations. With their high brightness levels and vibrant color reproduction, 3D video walls deliver stunning visual effects that are visible even in direct sunlight.</p>
