                <h2 class="title">What Is a Creative LED Screen?</h2>
                <p>This is not usual flat screen. Creative & flexible LED display incorporates the use of highly flexible circuit boards that allow molding into unusual shapes, such as curves, spirals, spheres, and waves.</p>
                <p>Unlike rigid panels, flexible LED screen conforms to your design, rather than you conforming to the design. Now you can create stunning visuals that complement architectural features. This will help you enhance immersive environments or add marketing impact to areas where conventional screens cannot. </p>
                <p>It is ideal for both outdoor and indoor applications. Some of the common settings include hotels, showrooms, exhibitions, and interactive art installations.</p>
