                <p>The primary difference between 2D and 3D display rests in our perception of the object represented on the screen.</p>
                <p>The 2D LED display often appears flat and requires solely two dimensions: length and width; so it is referred to as two-dimensional. On the contrary, the 3D LED display includes a dimension of depth in addition to the dimensions of length and width, which is why it is called three-dimensional.</p>
                <p>The addition of a third dimension in 3D LED screens enhances the realism of sights or images as compared to 2D displays. The application of 3D effects on huge LED screens improves the viewers' perception of the presented visuals. It enables the audience to see the illusion of three dimensions, witness the interactions of shadows and lights, and detect their movements.</p>
