                <p>In general, indoor and outdoor displays have a wide range of applications. The LED display has become an indispensable part of our lives, thanks to its impressive features such as bright illumination, minimal working voltage, low power consumption, large dimensions, long lifespan, impact resistance, and reliable operation. Indoor and outdoor LED display screens are expected to have a significant impact on the future market. Let's explore the differences between indoor LED screens and outdoor LED displays: </p>
                <p><b>Brightness Range</b></p>
                <p>Indoor LED displays often require lower brightness levels compared to outdoor LED screens due to the presence of sunlight. Indoor LED displays typically have a brightness level of approximately 800nits, whereas outdoor LED screens should have a minimum brightness of 5,500nits to ensure clear visibility of presented stuff. </p>
                <p><b>Pixel Pitches</b></p>
                <p>The choice of pixel pitch is directly linked to the distance from which the screen will be viewed. Indoor LED video walls require a smaller pixel pitch to prevent distortions when viewed up close, due to their shorter viewing distance. Outdoor LED displays often have a standard pixel pitch, such as P6. In addition, the increased dimensions of outdoor LED billboards typically necessitate a greater pixel pitch.</p>

                </div>
                <p><b>Protection Level</b></p>
                <p>Indoor LED display screens require a minimum IP40 protection rating, while outdoor LED displays need a higher rating of at least IP65. This is because outdoor environments are subject to unpredictable changes, necessitating screens that are sufficiently waterproof and dustproof to withstand extreme weather conditions such as rainfall, extreme temperatures, consistent sun exposure, and dust. </p>
                <p><b>Price Difference</b></p>
                <p>The material elements of LED displays may show significant variation. Furthermore, there are differences in both size and resolution. For instance, a direct view LED wall refers to a panel with a higher number of LED lamps, resulting in a higher price. Furthermore, a larger size indicates the same notion. </p>
