                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter1">Chapter 1  What is Direct View LED?</h3>
                <p>Direct view LED also known as fine pitch LED display, narrow pixel pitch LED display, or small pixel pitch LED display, typically refers to the LED video wall with a pixel pitch lower than 2.5mm. Considering the rapid evolution of the AV and LED display industry, direct view LED has now included pixel pitches below 2mm. The current trend is in favor of pixel pitches 1.56mm and 1.2mm. However, there is a 0.9mm option that is already available and is expected to dramatically lower the pixel pitch in the future. </p>
                <p>The present fine pitch LED display primarily applies 3 in 1 SMD technology. However, an increasing number of influential encapsulation companies are making significant investments in the research of Mini LED and Micro LED. Their aim is to achieve an even lower pixel pitch than 0.7mm and 0.9mm. The future of LED technology remains uncertain and unpredictable. </p>

                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter2">Chapter 2  What is 1080P, 2K and 4K?</h3>
                <p>The fine pitch LED display has become the primary option for visual displaying systems, offering the ability to showcase high definition or ultra-high definition content. To understand the resolution, it is important to get to grips yourself with terms like 1080P, 2K, and 4K.</p>
                <p>1080P, also referred to as Full HD or FHD, is a term widely employed to describe a high-definition video resolution. The resolution is 1920x1080 pixels, allowing for a higher level of detail compared to 720P. Such a resolution is often seen on a widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9. </p>
                <p>2K resolution often proves necessary for displaying content on direct view LED video walls. The resolution is 2048x1080. Although the number of pixels is the same vertically and very close at horizontally, 1080P and 2K are typically considered as two different resolution formats.</p>
                <div class="img-box">
                    <img src="../images/products/new-page/direct-view-led/direct-view-led-6.jpg" />
                </div>
                <p>4k, also referred to as ultra-high definition (UHD), is a term used primarily in television and consumer media to describe a fine pitch LED display resolution of 3840x2160, which has become the industry norm for 4K. At present, 4K TV have gained significant market share, just like the fine pitch LED displays. Everyone wants a direct view LED that can display video content with greater detail and clarity.  </p>
                <p>When searching for a high-quality direct view LED video wall, it is crucial to decide the right resolution.

                <p>Wall mounting and ground stacking are the most common installations for direct view LED video wall. However, it differs depending on the specific projects. Wall-mounting is the preferred method for installing most fine pitch LED displays. Here are the procedures for wall-mounting:</p>
                <p><b>Frame Installation</b></p>
                <p>Cinstar fine pitch LED video wall features incredibly lightweight and slim panel, eliminating the need for complex framing to support the entire screen. When perform the installation, the frame need to be installed at the first stage.</p>
                <p><b>LED Panel Installation</b></p>
                <p>The direct view LED modules are taken away from the panels when we perform the packing in factory, to avoid any damage on the LEDs during shipping. After installing the structure frame, the panels (without modules) should be installed accordingly. Then it comes to the cabling work.</p>
                <p><b>LED Module Attachment</b></p>
                <p>Once the cabling is complete, simply reattach the modules. Then you can easily set up the fine pitch LED display screen and configurate it to work. We can provide remote technical support, if you get the problem to get the screen working. </p>
                <p>
                Ground support or floor stacking is another common approach for installing direct view LED video wall. Furthermore, the fine pitch LED display is able to be combined with a particular support frame to function as an LED TV for an immersive home cinema experience or similar purposes. Here are a few key points to consider when installing the direct view LED with floor stacking.</p>
