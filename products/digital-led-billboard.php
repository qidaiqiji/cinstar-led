                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter3">Chapter 3  Installations of LED Display Billboard</h3>
                <p>Essentially, there are three different methods to accomplish this, depending on the specific application of the LED billboard. The LED display billboard can be installed using various methods, such as hanging, wall mount, or standing on the floor or other LED display installation options. If you come across alternative ways of installing it, there's no need to be concerned. They are simply variations of these three primary methods. This is how they are done.</p>
                <p><b>Hanging LED Billboard</b></p>
                <p>When it comes to hanging installation, it's important to consider the weight of the LED billboard while selecting a suitable location for it. It is crucial also to ensure that the digital LED billboard you plan to use is capable of being suspended. The LED display billboard with this feature often include locks to securely hold all the cabinets. In addition, it is necessary to take into consideration the wind force when installing the LED billboard outdoors or in a semi-outdoor location, as this is vital for safety purposes.</p>
                <div class="img-box">
                    <img src="../images/products/new-page/digital-led-billboard/digital-led-billboard-10.jpg" />
                </div>
                <p><b>Wall Mounted LED Billboard</b></p>
                <p>Wall mount installations are relatively easy, the installation frame has to be bolted onto the wall firmly. This mounting method is used extensively for both indoor and outdoor LED billboard. The frame is designed to tightly secure the LED billboard screen, simply use the wall mount slot and wall mount locks provided on the frame. Before proceeding, it's important to keep in mind that the combined weight of the LED billboard and frame should not exceed the maximum weight limit that the wall can support. It is advisable to avoid mounting the LED billboard sign on a thin structure.</p>
                <p><b>Pole Installation LED Billboard</b></p>
                <p>This is an easy method for mounting the LED billboard. There are two methods you can accomplish this task. You have the option to choose between a unipolar style or a double-column style. If you choose the unipolar style, the screen's size must typically be smaller than 30 square meters. As stated by the name, a single pole is sufficient to support the screen. The double-column design has a maximum capacity of around 100 square meters of the LED billboard. The poles will be equipped with frames to securely fasten the billboard. For this type of installation, if you are green hand to this, we advise you to engage the services of experts. </p>

                <h3 class="chapter-title" id="chapter4">Chapter 4  How to Control LED Billboard?</h3>
                <p><b>Synchronous Controlling</b></p>
                <p>Basically, synchronous control refers to the method of showing images or videos on an LED billboard with the use of an external input source. External sources include many devices such as PCs, DVD or Blu-Ray players, cameras, VCRs, and so on. This can be achieved by deploying an synchronous control card. The LED billboard will consistently require the presence of the control card in order to show videos and images.</p>
                <p>Synchronous control system is primarily utilized in outdoor and indoor advertising billboard displays, LED stage screen, sports LED displays, and studio LED displays etc. </p>
                <p><b>Asynchronous controlling</b></p>
                <p>In contrast, an asynchronous control system does not depend on an external source to present the video. A crucial thing to note is that the LED billboard will consistently function independently. Videos or images are subject to editing on a computer.</p>
                <p>The data will be transmitted to the control card using various means such as a UTP cat5 cable, a USB drive, a WiFi connection, 4G wireless, or other forms of data transmission. After the control card successfully receives the data, it will store it in its memory, and you can then disconnect. Subsequently, the LED display billboard will continuously play the videos or images until you deactivate it.</p>
                <p>This configuration is optimal. In cases where the control computer is located at a significant distance from the digital LED billboard or if the installation situation is not conducive to wiring or cabling.</p>
                <p>Typically, the asynchronous controlling is employed for LED billboard displays at shop entrances, small LED signage, totem LED billboard displays or outdoor LED advertising.</p>
