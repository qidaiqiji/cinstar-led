                <p>The project features the company's M3.9 LED screen model, a lightweight yet durable solution specifically engineered for high-impact indoor applications. The setup includes a 17 × 1 meter display for Luleå and three sets of 10 × 1 meter screens for Boden. Designed as rink-side fence displays, the systems perfectly align with the architectural structure of the arenas, offering both functionality and visual appeal.</p>

                <h3>A New Visual Experience for Hockey Fans</h3>

                <p>Its key specifications include:</p>
