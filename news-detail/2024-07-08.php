                <p>Cinstar is thrilled to be the supplier of two striking media cube LED video wall panels, and we owe a great deal of gratitude to our strategic Swedish partner for their trust as well as their hard work and professionalism. It is anticipated that the new media cubes will provide an even more spectacular visual experience and update the old-fashioned LED bucket screens that have been in operation for more than 10 years.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The project comes to two media cubes with intriguing designs. Both two media cubes are supposed to be hoisted with telfers on the roof. During the off-season, when the arena is occupied for activities or events, the cubes could be elevated into the air with small cube remaining behind the larger one.</p>

                <p>After two months of production and rigorous quality control, the two impressive customized Cinstar P4 media cube LED video wall panels (total 108.85SQM) are finally ready for FAT and shipping. </p>

                </div>
                <p>The media cube LED video wall panels are designed with around 10 degrees leaning forward to provide a better visual enjoyment for all the spectators in the ice hockey arena. Each irregular corner of the media cubes is strictly controlled to maintain the perfect smooth curve and seamless connection to the flat parts. In order to get the normal image/video display at the corner parts, Cinstar R&D team utilized the advanced pixel skipping technology (customized and reprogrammed driver ICs) to make sure of that. </p>
                <div class="img-box" style="width: 50%">

                </div>
                <p>All the installation structures for the media cubes are customized and made in China. Cinstar did the recommendation and coordinated all the collaboration work with the structure manufacturer to make sure that the structures are compatible with Cinstar LED video wall panels and greatly ease the onsite installation work.</p>
