                    Large scale LED display is always the preferred channel for outdoor commercial media not only for its high brightness, vivid color and wide viewing angle, but also its unlimited dimension and brilliant visual impact.

                    With the installation permit is more and more difficult to get for high way or road side installation, the shopping mall façade is becoming a perfect spot for setting up a giant led video screen for its superb geographic location with a good flow of people and excellent visibility. For such wall mounting installation, the display system must be slim and light weight and able to install and maintain from front. Cinstar FT series and DB series are specially designed for such installations.
