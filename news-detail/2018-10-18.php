                    LED display is an integrated industrial product rather than accumulation of piles of materials. Even with same materials, the image quality of different manufacturer varies a lot. That is the difference of technology and process design. That is why we can see very different image quality when touring on an exhibition.

                    Cinstar LED display is designed by experienced technicians, from the PCB board to cable layout and finished product, each procedure is tested at very high standard to ensure the high quality image output.
