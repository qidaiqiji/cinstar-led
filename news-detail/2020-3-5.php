                <p>In the middle of January, we close one deal with our Belgium customer for a trial HD1.87 screen for several shopping centers in Belgium. The screen size is 12x3 panels, screen size 7.2mx1.10m. If this trial screen works nice, there will be 10-20 pcs more.

                <p>
                With the impact of virus, the production capacity of all of our material suppliers is greatly affected. Which in return will affect our lead time. It is a fact that the lead time will be longer than before, but Cinstar has taken every possible measures to shorten the production time and ease the impact on customer’s project schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                Coronavirus caused a big inconvenience to our work and threaten our lives, hope all the people around the world will stay together and take his/her responsibility to prevent spread of the virus and win this battle very soon.
