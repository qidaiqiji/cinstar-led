                    <a href="https://www.cinstar-led.com/products/outdoor-led-display-screen.php"><b>Outdoor led screen</b></a> is now the trend of OOH advertising for its seamless splicing, excellent image quality and manageable content comparing to traditional printing advertising.

                <p>
                    Except the normal wall mounted installation billboard, another kind of LED display is widely used for both OOH advertising and building façade decoration, which is called curtain or mesh screens. See through design is perfect for wind resistance and won’t block the scenery outside of buildings. IP67 waterproof is durable for any weather conditions. All these advantages make the <a href="https://www.cinstar-led.com/products/outdoor-led-display-screen.php"><b>outdoor led display</b></a> preferred for shopping mall, stadium and huge size advertising.
                </p>

                    Last week, 28sqm of Cinstar MC15 screen was installed to COOP arena building wall to replace the printing advertising. The reason why COOP arena chose <a href="https://www.cinstar-led.com/products/outdoor-led-display-screen.php"><b>outdoor led video wall</b></a> is because they have to change printing advertising twice a year due to snow and rain damage. Which cost a lot and shows low quality advertising. But the customer had requirement on see-through since the area installed LED display is a rest area. People need to see outside. Cinstar MC15 is perfect for that location.
