                    Last week, our UK customer delivered 45sqm of Cinstar LM2.6 screen for Dale Farm’s AGM. The system was with ground stacking application. The huge viewing angle(160degree) and excellent contrast ratio (5000:1) ensured the remarkable visual performance for all the attendees. The customer was pleased to the perfect image quality and great stability.
