                    Recently, our customer installed several columns in one shopping center in UK. They adopted our LM 3.9 for such creative installations. The main difficulties were fully front serviceable and cutting-edge 90 degree corners. And the reason why the customer chose our solution mainly because our LM series can cope with it easily. This series display enables front or rear services, support concave or convex and even right angle installations.

                    The customer and shopping center owner were very satisfied to the creative installation and its superb visual attraction. Such impressive columns will definitely bring more attention to the shopping center and in return maximize its advertising effect.
